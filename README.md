# Basic-Website-Projects - Binary-To-Decimal-Converter

This project aims as being my first complete website after reading Books and self educating on web development, I have created alot more impressive tech demos but do not plan to release them as I desire there to be more content aimed at a goal and not the pretty CSS side only. 

Discription:

- This website is able to take in a BYTE (8 Bits) and display the outputing decimal number that is equal to the inputed binary.
- Features:
  - will tell the user if your binary number is below or above the requested BYTE needed to forfill the code on this site.
  - also this website will tell the user if the number that was entered was not a binary number or not.

Thank you for any support or ideas and I am looking forward to making more cool ideas come to life.
